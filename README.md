# 🍋 melon-4
A theme for [Trilium Notes](https://github.com/zadam/trilium), (>= 0.48.x) "_a hierarchical note taking application with focus on building large personal knowledge bases_". 

I really like this application and its many features. At the same time I felt like it needed some visual _overhaul_ for lack of better terms. I am trying to achieve a consistent look and feel. Sometimes things break (e.g. due to updates of the application) - please don't hesitate to file an issue!

## Additional Fonts
To get the full experience you need to install some additional fonts.
- The web font files (.woff) have to be imported into the theme note (right click on theme note, select _Import into note_)
- the _customResourceProvider_ attribute needs to be added to every font file you want to use
- the respective attribute _value_ should be _fonts/Font-File-Name.woff_
